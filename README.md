# Block Websites But Allow Specific Pages Within

I usually keep websites like Youtube or Reddit blocked but often I search about a topic and the relevant links are often the Youtube video or reddit posts, which I want to be able to access without having to disable my website blocker. So I created this website blocker that keeps the direct access to Youtube, Reddit etc, e.g. `*youtube.com/*` or `*reddit.com/*`, blocked but allows accessing of specific pages within, e.g. `*youtube.com/watch*` or `*reddit.com/r/*`.

I vibe coded this repo so some logic might not be accurate.
